Bootcamp: UBHM_Module 9 Project 1

AS a traveler who needs to plan the next holiday
I WANT to know the exchange currency for possible countries that I would like to visit, and also the COVID cases for safety reasons.
SO THAT I can have a better plan according to my budget, and health concerns.

We created an app which provides the data for Currency rates, and number of active COVID cases, using two different APIs.

The user log into the website, and input 3 required information (destination country, currency type and budget).
